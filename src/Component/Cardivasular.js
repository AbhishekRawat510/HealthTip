        <ul>
          <li>Engage in regular aerobic exercise: Participate in activities that elevate your heart rate and make you breathe harder. Examples include brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, dancing, or playing sports. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week.</li>
          <li>Start slowly and gradually increase intensity: If you're new to exercise or have been inactive for a while, start with low-impact activities and gradually increase the duration and intensity of your workouts. Consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program.</li>
          <li>Include strength training: Incorporate strength training exercises at least two days a week. Strengthening your muscles helps support your cardiovascular health and overall fitness. Use weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, and lunges.</li>
          <li>Maintain a healthy weight: Excess weight puts strain on your cardiovascular system. Aim for a healthy weight range by combining regular exercise with a balanced diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.</li>
          <li>Eat a heart-healthy diet: Opt for a diet low in saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. Include foods rich in fiber, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Choose lean sources of protein like fish, poultry, and beans.</li>
