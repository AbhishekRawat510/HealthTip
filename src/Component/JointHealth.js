      <h1>General tips for Joint Health and Arthritis</h1>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay physically active: Engage in regular low-impact exercises like walking, swimming, cycling, or water aerobics. Exercise helps improve joint flexibility, strengthens muscles around the joints, and maintains overall joint health. Consult with a healthcare professional or physical therapist to determine the best exercises for your specific condition.</li>
          <li>Maintain a healthy weight: Excess weight puts additional stress on your joints, particularly weight-bearing joints like knees and hips. Maintain a healthy weight to reduce the strain on your joints and slow down the progression of arthritis.</li>
          <li>Protect your joints: Use joint-friendly techniques when performing daily activities. For example, use proper body mechanics when lifting heavy objects, avoid repetitive motions that strain your joints, and use assistive devices like braces, splints, or walking aids if necessary.</li>
          <li>Apply heat or cold therapy: Use heat packs or warm towels to soothe stiff joints and relieve pain. Cold therapy with ice packs can help reduce inflammation and swelling. Alternate between hot and cold treatments as needed.</li>
          <li>Practice gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises: Regularly perform gentle stretching exercises to maintain or improve joint flexibility. Include range-of-motion exercises that move your joints through their full range of motion to prevent stiffness.</li>
