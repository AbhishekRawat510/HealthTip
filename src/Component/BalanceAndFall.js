        <ul>
          <li>Stay physically active: Engage in activities that improve strength, flexibility, and balance, such as yoga, tai chi, or specific balance exercises. Regular exercise helps improve muscle tone, coordination, and overall balance.</li>
          <li>Create a safe living environment: Remove potential hazards in your home that could lead to falls, such as loose rugs, cluttered pathways, or poor lighting. Install handrails in stairways and grab bars in bathrooms for support.</li>
          <li>Wear appropriate footwear: Choose shoes that provide good support and have non-slip soles. Avoid high heels or shoes with slippery soles, as they can increase the risk of falls.</li>
          <li>Be mindful of your surroundings: Pay attention to your environment, especially when walking on uneven surfaces or in crowded areas. Watch out for obstacles, changes in elevation, or slippery surfaces.</li>
          <li>Improve lighting: Ensure that your home is well-lit, especially in hallways, staircases, and areas prone to shadows. Use night lights in bedrooms and bathrooms to help navigate during the night.</li>
