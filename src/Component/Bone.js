        <ul>
          <li>Ensure an adequate calcium intake: Calcium is essential for building and maintaining strong bones. Include calcium-rich foods in your diet such as dairy products, leafy green vegetables, fortified cereals, and canned fish with bones. If necessary, consider calcium supplements, but consult with your healthcare provider for the appropriate dosage.</li>
          <li>Get enough vitamin D: Vitamin D helps the body absorb and utilize calcium effectively. Spend some time outdoors in the sunlight to allow your body to naturally produce vitamin D. Additionally, consume foods rich in vitamin D like fatty fish, fortified dairy products, and egg yolks. In some cases, vitamin D supplements may be recommended by your healthcare provider.</li>
          <li>Engage in weight-bearing exercises: Weight-bearing exercises help strengthen bones and improve bone density. Activities such as walking, jogging, dancing, hiking, and strength training with weights or resistance bands are beneficial for bone health. Consult with a healthcare professional or physical therapist to develop an exercise program that suits your abilities and needs.</li>
          <li>Consume a balanced diet: Maintain a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrients important for bone health, such as magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin K, and other essential vitamins and minerals. Include a wide range of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats in your meals.</li>
          <li>Be cautious with fall prevention: Falls can lead to fractures, especially for individuals with osteoporosis. Take precautions to prevent falls, such as removing hazards in your living environment, using handrails on stairs, wearing appropriate footwear, and maintaining good lighting.</li>
